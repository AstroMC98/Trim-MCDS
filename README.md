# Exploring Protein-Protein Interaction Networks - Exploring Edge Pruning via conditional Attributes

This study aims to explore the potential for identifying salient proteins for targetted drug research using a combination of the Dominating Set Theory and Edge Pruning. We performed data wrangling and cleaning as well as edge pruning as our initial step. We utilize a novel method for Edge Pruning that utilizes inherent edge attributes as node states and isolating only edges that follow a set number of rules. Finally, we performed the Minimum Leaf Spanning Tree Algorithm to determine the Minimum Connected Dominating Set of the PPI Network.
